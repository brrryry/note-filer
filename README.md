## CS584 Final Project: Note Filer
The objective of this project is to be able to take notes and classify them automatically using a language model. \
TBD
## How to use
First, clone the repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:brrryry/note-filter.git
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Modify the ``.env`` file to tailor your discord application. \
From there, you should be all set! You can run ``npm deploy-commands.js`` to deploy slash commands, and you can use ``node .`` to start the bot up! \
Happy programming!
